Supplementary Recording Sessions for Objective Analysis

You Raise Me Up:
ASEK-Best, G, Self-assessment: quite suitable
Original, D#, Self-assessment: too high to even sing, unwilling to continue singing

O Solo Mio:
ASKE-Best, B, Self-assessment: suitable and shows my beautiful vocal part
Original, G#, Self-assessment: although the treble part is effortless, the start is too low and some notes are at the limit

Thatâ€™s Why (You Go Away)
ASKE-Best, C#, Self-assessment: very suitable to my voice
Original, G, Self-assessment: too low to even sing, unwilling to continue singing
