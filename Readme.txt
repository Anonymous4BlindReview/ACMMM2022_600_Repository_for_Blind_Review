To improve the results' objectivity currently, we recorded 50 singing sessions of eight of the subjects with their consent and shared them here for peer evaluation.

Sessions to be recorded were selected as follows:

  1. The song must have a widely recognized original key.
  2. The key(s) calculated for a particular singer evaluated as the most comfortable should have some distance away from the original key, e.g., two semitones or more.

In this way, whether the automatically estimated keys are superior can be verified subjectively by singers' self-comparison and objectively by third-party listeners' hearing evaluation as well as the AI-based singing assessment of the recorded waveforms.

The two versions of the songs with the same name under each folder represent the original key and the key estimated by ASKE that was rated as the most pleasing.

At this stage, by hearing and comparing the recording sessions in the repository, the soundness of our proposed method can be objectively convincing even without AI assistance.
