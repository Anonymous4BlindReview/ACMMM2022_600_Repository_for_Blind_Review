Supplementary Recording Sessions for Objective Analysis

You Raise Me Up:
ASEK-Best, A#, Self-assessment: never sang it so comfortable, match my voice so well
Original, D#, Self-assessment: too high in the chorus, my voice is not beautiful at all

O Sole Mio:
ASKE-Best, C#, Self-assessment: for tenor it is a low key, but suit my voice nowadays
Original, G#, Self-assessment: even I made it, but in a strained and inelegant way

Without You:
ASKE-Best, A, Self-assessment: suitable, the lowest and highest part are both good
Original, F#, Self-assessment: the lowest part leans on my voice limit

Late Summer (Natsu No Owari):
ASKE-Best, B, Self-assessment: very comfortable, I enjoyed
Original, E, Self-assessment: tired, too high, singing at the top of my lungs but still not well
